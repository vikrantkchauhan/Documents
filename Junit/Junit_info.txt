========================JUNIT===============================

---Writing code---
1. Analyze the requirement
2. Design the aproach
3. Write the code
4. Write the test -> Run the test
5. If success then push to dev->cert->UAT
6. Release->Support->Enhancements
7. Documentation at each phase (LLD, HLD)


---Testing is to make sure that the code works in future also
-- When we make changes to the system(so that our basic functionality works properly)
