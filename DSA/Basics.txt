=======================Data Structures by Dinesh varyani=================

Data Structures: 2 types 
1. Linear(Arrays, LinkedList, Stack, Queue)
2. Non Linear (Tree , Graph)


Algorithm:
Set of instructions to perform a task or to solve a problem

Asymptotic analysis helps in evalutaing performance of an algorithm in terms of space and time complexity.

Time complexity: time taken for the execution of algorithm
Space complexity: space taken for execution of the algorithm(auxiliary space)

Time complexity: n^x > (x)n > n > nlogn> logn

Best(Omega)->Lower bound 

Avegrage(Theta)-> Average bound

Worst(BigO) ->Upper bound (Rules: Single processsor, Sequential execution, operation takes constant 1 unit of time, drop lower order terms from eg)
