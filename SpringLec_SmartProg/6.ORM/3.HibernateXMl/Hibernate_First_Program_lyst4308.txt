=> Steps to create Hibernate First Program :-
	1. Download & Install any IDE (Eclipse)
	2. Create "Simple Java Project" or "Maven Project"
	3. Add "hibernate jars" (for java project) or "provide dependencies" (for maven project)
	4. Create "POJO class"
	5. Create "Hibernate Mapping File"
	6. Create "Hibernate Configuration File"
	7. Create main class to execute hibernate application with following steps :-
		
		7.1 Create "Configuration" object :-
			-> The Configuration class is used to configure and manage hibernate settings
			-> How to get Configuration object :-
				** Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
			-> Methods of Configuration class :-
				** configure()	// It is used to load the hibernate configuration details from an external file
				
		7.2 Create "SessionFactory" object :-
			-> SessionFactory is an interface that represents a factory for creating "Session" objects
			-> It is used to load the configuration details from configuration file, setting up connection pool, manage database connections etc
			-> How to get SessionFactory object :-
				** SessionFactory sessionFactory = cfg.buildSessionFactory();
				
		7.3 Create "Session" object :-
			-> Session is an interface that represents a single unit of work
			-> It is used to perform database operations
			-> How to get Session object :-
				** Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
			
			-> Database operations that we can perform using Session object are :-
				a. Insert operation
					= save()
					= persist()
				b. Update operation
					= update()
					= saveOrUpdate()
				c. Delete operation
					= delete()
				d. Retrieve operation
					= get()
					= load()
					
		7.4 Create "Transaction" object :-
			-> Transaction is an interface that represents database transaction
			-> It is used to control and manage transactions
			-> How to get Transaction object :-
				** Transaction transaction = session.getTransaction()
				   transaction.begin();
				** Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction();
					
			-> NOTE : In JDBC, AutoCommit default value is "true" and we have to set it to "false" by "con.setAutoCommit(false);" statement. But in hibernate AutoCommit default value is "false"
