>> Terms we should know <<
---------------------------


=> ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) :-
	-> ORM is a programming technique that allows data to be mapped between "Object" in object-oriented programming code and "Relational Database" using XML file or annotations
		= We can compare it with OOP, AOP etc
	-> It will map the "Object" and "Relational Database" in such a way that :-
		= model class(object) corresponds to the table
		= properties map to the table column
		= property / object values become row in database table
	-> ORM simplifies database interactions in object-oriented programming langauges, making it easier for developer to work with database
	-> Some java related ORM tools (frameworks) are :-
		1. Hibernate
		2. JPA (Java Persistence API)
		3. TopLink
		4. EclipseLink
		5. MyBatis
		   etc
		   
	-> NOTE :-
		= ORM is not developed by a specific individual or organization. It is a collaborative effort programming technique on which many organizations are working together
		= ORM is typically used with relational databases (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL etc). We normally does not use ORM with NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis etc)

=> Data Persistency :-
	-> Data means information and persistency means permanent
	-> Data Persistency is the ability to store the data permanently in a way that it is not lost when the program or system is no longer running
	-> To achieve data-persistency wrt java we have following techniques or technologies :-
		1. Serialization and Deserialization
		2. JDBC
		3. ORM
			= Hibernate
			= JPA
			= TopLink
			= EclipseLink
			= MyBatis
			  etc
		etc
