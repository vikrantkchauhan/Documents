=> What is Resource ?
	-> Whenever we need to load or read any external file/resource i.e. xml file, text file, properties file, image etc then we use Resource
	-> Resource is an pre-defined interface present in "org.springframework.core.io" package
	-> Spring framework has provided some implemented classes for Resource interface :-
		1. ClassPathResource
		2. URLResource
		3. InputStreamResource
		4. ByteArrayResource
		5. FileSystemResource
		   etc
		   
		   
=> What is BeanFactory ?
	-> It is the core interface in the Spring Framework for managing and accessing the beans
	-> It serves as a "Spring Container" that instantiate, configure, manage bean life cycle etc
	
	
=> What is ApplicationContext ?
	-> It is the sub-interface of BeanFactory for managing and accessing bean objects
	-> It serves as a "Spring Container" which provides more functionailites as compared to BeanFactory
	-> In simple terms we can say that it is an advanced spring container as compared to BeanFactory

=> Difference between BeanFactory & ApplicationContext ?
	1. BeanFactory is the core container or fundamental container
	   ApplicationContext is an advanced spring container which provides all the functionailites of BeanFactory container
	   
	2. BeanFactory creates the bean object when we call getBean(-) method and thus it is known as lazy instantiation
	   ApplicationContext creates the bean object when the container gets started and thus it is known as eager instantiation
	   
	3. BeanFactory supports only singleton and prototype scope
	   ApplicationContext supports singleton, prototype, request, session scopes
	   
	4. BeanFactory does not support I18N functionality
	   ApplicationContext supports I18N functionality
	   
	5. BeanFactory does not support AOP and ORM
	   ApplicationContext supports AOP and ORM
	   
	6. BeanFactory does not support annotations
	   ApplicationContext supports annotations
	   
	7. BeanFactory is suitable for Standalone Applications
	   ApplicationContext is suitable for Enterprise Applications
