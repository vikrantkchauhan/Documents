=> Logging :-
	-> Logging is the process of tracking or recording important information, events, messages or issues that occur during the execution of our application.
	-> The log files generated during logging process will help the developers or system administrators to monitor the application behaviour, diagous issues and track the errors
	
	-> Use of logging :-
		1. Error Tracking and Debugging :-
			= In web applications we can track the errors like error generated during form submission
		2. Security Monitering :-
			= We can track security-related events such as failed to login attempts or unautorized acces attempts
		3. Auditing & Compliance :-
			= A financial application might log all the financial transactions including the details of transaction, its time, location etc
		4. Performace Analysis :-
			= We can track the time taken by our application to perform any event or respond
		5. System Health Monitoring :-
			= In server enviornment we can track the memory usage, CPU load and other metrics
		6. Deployment & Release Management :-
			= We can track the version number, time of releasing the application etc
		etc
		
	-> Where we can use logging :-
		1. Software Development
			= Web Development
			= Mobile App Development
		2. DevOps & Infrastructure :-
			= Server Applications
			= Databases
		3. Networking & Security :-
			= Firewall & Security Appliances
			= Network Servers
		4. Cloud Computing :-
			= Cloud Servers
			= Serverless Computing
		5. Industrial Automation & IoT :-
			= Industrial Control Systems
			= IoT Devices
		etc
		
		
	-> Logging process is supported by many languages i.e. java, python, php, JavaScript, Node JS etc
	
	-> There are a lot of API's & Frameworks for logging :-
		1. Java Logging API
		2. Log4j
		3. Logback
		4. Tinylog
		
		5. SLF4j
		6. JCL (Jakarta Commons Logging) - old name was Apache Commons Logging
		   (5th and 6th are logging wrappers)

1. Java Logging API :-
	-> Java Logging API was introduced in JDK 1.4 version
	-> It is pre-defined in JDK so no need to download any jar file or provide dependency
	-> This API is present in "java.util.logging" package
	-> Components of logging :-
		= There are 2 components in logging :-
			i. Logger
			ii. Handler
			
----------------------------------------------

i. Logger :-
	-> Logger is an object in logging framework that you use to emit the log messages
	-> Some levels of Logger are :-
		1. SEVERE (highest value)
		2. WARNING
		3. INFO
		4. CONFIG
		5. FINE
		6. FINER
		7. FINEST (lowest value)
		
		
ii. Handler :-
	-> Handler is also an object that listens the messages at or above a specified minimum security level
	-> Handler will take the messages and post it to the provided medium like console or file or database
	-> There are 5 handlers :-
		1. ConsoleHandler
		2. FileHandler
		3. StreamHandler
		4. SocketHandler
		5. MemoryHandler
