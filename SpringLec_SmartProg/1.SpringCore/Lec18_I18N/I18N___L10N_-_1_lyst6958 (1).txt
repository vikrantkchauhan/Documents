=> Whenever we create an application, we always want to execute it for different countries having different languages and time zones and cultures

=> For this purpose we use "Internationalization" and "Localization"

=> Some data or information that is different for different countries :-
	= Number
	= Currency
	= Date
	= Time
	= Messages
	= Phone Numbers
	= Address
	  etc

======================================================================================================

=> Internationalization :-
	-> It is also known as "I18N"
	-> Internationalization means designing and creating the application (web or software) in such a way that makes them easy to adapt for the people of different countries or cultures
	-> It's like making the foundation that can later be customized to fit for the preferences and languages of different countries
	

=> Localization
	-> It is also known as "L10N"
	-> It is like taking the foundation from Internationalization and customzing it for a specific reason or language or culture
	

=> To achieve Internationalization and Localization, java has provided some pre-defined classes :-
	1. Locale
	2. NumberFormat
	   DecimalFormat
	3. Currency
	4. DateFormat
	   SimpleDateFormat
	5. ResourceBundle
	   etc
