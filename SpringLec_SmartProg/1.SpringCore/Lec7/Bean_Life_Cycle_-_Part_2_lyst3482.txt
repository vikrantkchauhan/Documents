=> Aware Interfaces :-
	-> Aware interfaces are the set of interfaces which provides a way for beans to aware (or interact) with their environment and obtain important resources during the application context startup
	-> Some commonly aware interfaces used are :-
		1. BeanNameAware
		2. BeanFactoryAware
		3. ApplicationContextAware
		   etc
	-> NOTE : We can use other approches in place of aware interfaces
	

--------------------------------------

1. BeanNameAware :-
	-> It is used to make the bean aware of its assigned name in the spring container
	-> This can be usedful in various scenerios where the bean needs to know its identifier or interact with other beans based on its name
	-> It is a pre-defined interface having method i.e.
		= setBeanName(String beanName)
		

2. BeanFactoryAware :-
	-> It is used to aware the bean for BeanFactory. It provides the bean with a reference to the BeanFactory, which is useful in certain scenerios when the bean needs to access the other beans or when it requires dynamic instantiation of other bean
	-> It is a pre-defined interface having method i.e.
		= setBeanFactory(BeanFactory beanFactory)
		
		
3. ApplicationContextAware :-
	-> It is used to aware the bean for ApplicationContext. It is same as BeanFactoryAware but provides a lot of extra features i.e. internationalization, event propagation, resource loading etc
	-> It is a pre-defined interface having method i.e.
		= setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext)

=> BeanPostProcessor :-
	-> It allows us to customize the bean instantiation and initialization process.
	-> In simple words we can say that it allows us to perform custom processing on beans as they are being constructed and initialized by the spring container
	-> It is a pre-defined interface having methods i.e.
		= postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object beanObj, String beanName)
		= postProcessAfterInitialization(Object beanObj, String beanName)
