=> Editions In Java :-
	-> There are 3 editions in java :-
		1. J2SE (Java 2 Standard Edition) - Core Java
		2. J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise Edition) - Advance Java
		3. J2ME (Java 2 Micro Edition) - Mobiles, Embded System (remotes, ATM's, TV, Washing Machines etc)


=> Types of applications in java :-
	-> We can create 2 types of applications in java :-
		1. Standalone Applications
			= These are the applications which are executed only on single system
			= These applications can be developed using J2SE
			= These applications does not follows the client-server architecture
			= There are 2 types of standalone applications :-
				a. CUI (Character User Interface) Applications
					- Console Based App or Command Line User Interface or Text-Based App
				b. GUI (Graphical User Interface) Applications
		2. Enterprise Applications
			= These are the applications which are executed on multiple systems
			= These applications are developed using J2EE
			= These applications follows the client-server architecture
			= There are 2 types of enterprise applications :-
				a. Web Applications
				b. Distributed Applications


=> What is Enterprise ?
	-> "Enterprise" term is used for large scale companies which has multiple departments, levels, divisons or groups
	-> For eg :-
		= TATA Group : Consumer and retail, Hotels, IT, Automobiles, Steel, Power etc
		= Mahindra Group : IT, Automobiles, Defence, Education, Financial Services etc
		   etc

=> What is Enterprise Applications ?
	-> "Enterprise Applications" are large-scale, distributed, transaction and highly available applications which are designed to support the enterprise business requirements
	-> To develop enterprise applications we have to use a lot of technologies, multiple design patterns, system architectures .


=> Web Applications :-
	-> Client : Browser
	-> Server : Web Server or Application Server
	-> Technologies Used : Servlet, JSP, Spring MVC, JSF, Play Framework, Struts etc
	-> Architecture :-
		

=> Distributed Applications :-
	-> Client : Browser, Desktop Application, Mobile Application, IoT Device etc
	-> Server : Application Server
	-> Technologies Used : EJB (Enterprise Java Beans), Spring framework, JPA (Java Persistence API), Hibernate, JTA (Java Transaction API), JMS (Java Message Service) etc
	-> Architecture :-
		

=> Difference between Web Server and Application Server :-
	= Web Server is lightweight
	   Application Server is heavy weight

	= Web server contains only web containers (servlet container, JSP container etc)
	   Application server contains web container + EJB container

	= Web server is good for static contents like html pages
	   Application server is good for dynamic contents

	= Web server consumes less resources i.e. CPU, memory etc
	   Application server use more resources

	= Web server examples are : Apache Tomcat, Resin etc
	   Application server examples are : Weblogic, JBoss, Websphere etc


=> What is framework ?
	-> Frameworks are the pre-written code acting as a template which can be used or customized by the developers
	-> In simple terms we can say that frameworks are the collections of API's and tools which can be used to develop projects
	-> For example : Spring, Struts, Hibernate, Angular, React etc


=> Advantages of frameworks :-
	-> Fast development speed
	-> Less code (because it removes the boilerplate code)
	-> Support API integration
	-> Customizable (open source)
	-> Easy to debug
	-> Good documentation support
	     etc


=> Types of frameworks :-
	-> There are 2 types of frameworks :-
		1. Web Framework
			= eg. Struts, JSF etc
		2. Application Framework
			= eg. Spring etc
