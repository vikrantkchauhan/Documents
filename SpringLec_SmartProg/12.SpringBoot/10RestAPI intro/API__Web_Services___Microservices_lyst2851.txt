=> API :-
	-> Full form of API is Application Programming Interface
	-> API is an application component (or piece of code) which is used for communication between different systems over the network
	-> API acts as bridge between different systems or devices
	-> For example :-
		= Login API's (google and facebook login API)
		= Google Map API's
		= Payment Gateway API's
		= Airline, Bus, Train Booking API's
		= Movie Booking API's
		= Weather API's
		= Youtube, Amazon, Flipkart API's etc
		  etc
	-> Types of API's :-
		1. Public or Open API's
			= These are open to the public which can be used by anyone.
			= These API's can be paid or free of cost
		2. Partner API's
			= These API's are meant for business-to-business partnership
		3. Private or Internal API's
			= These are internal to any specific enterprice application within the company
		4. Composit API's
			= These combine any two or more different API's for any system or project

=> Web Services :-
	-> Web Services are a type of API used to exchange the data (XML or JSON) between different systems over the network
	-> Web services are independent of the platform on which they are developed. For example if we have created web services in java, then it can communicate with any other language also like python or php etc
	-> Web services use HTTP protocol
	-> NOTE :-
		= All web services are API's but not all API's are web services
		= To test web services we will use "Postman" tool
	-> There are 2 types of web services :-
		= SOAP web services
		= RESTful web services

=> Microservices :-
	-> Microservices is software architecture used to design an application. The idea behind the application development is that "create small independent components (or services) which performs simple task, then merge or integrate them into a single unit to build a large complex application"
	-> Monolithic approch was replaced by Microservices
	-> Advantages of Microservices :-
		= easy to scale
		= fast to develop
		= easy to maintain
		= easy to test
		= easy to deploy
		  etc
	-> There are many technologies to develop microservices but mostly used technology is Java and its frameworks (Springboot, Spark, DropWizard, Jersey etc)
