=> Jackson Annotations :-
	
	1. @JsonProperty :-
		-> It is used to indicate the mapping between a JSON property and a corresponding Java Object property during serialization and deserialization
		-> It can be used with property or getter/setter methods
		
	2. @JsonAlias :-
		-> It is used to provide alternative names for j JSON property during deserialization
		-> It can be used with property or getter/setter methods or in constructor arguments
		
	3. @JsonIgnore :-
		-> It is used to indicate that the specific property or getter method or setter method should be ignored in the JSON representation or being mapped from the JSON input during serialization and deserialization process
		-> It is used with properties or getter/setter methods or in constructor arguments
		
	4. @JsonIgnoreProperties :-
		-> It is used to ignore certain properties when mapping to or from JSON during serialization and deserialization
		-> It is used at class level
		
	5. @JsonFormat :-
		-> It is used to customize the formatting of date/time values during serialization and deserialization
		-> It can be used with property or getter/setter methods
		
	6. @JsonAnyGetter :-
		-> It is used to dynamically serialize properties of a class that do not have explicit mapping. It allows us to include additional properties in the serialized JSON that are not explicitly defined as properties or getter methods
		
	7. @JsonAnySetter :-
		-> It is used to dynamically deserialize properties of a class that do not have explicit mapping. It allows us to include additional properties in the deserialized JSON that are not explicitly defined as properties or setter methods
