=> @Controller :-
	-> It is stereotype annotation that indicates that a class serves the role of controller
	-> Syntax :-
		@Controller
		class MyController
		{
			
		}
		
	-> It indicates that the annotated class is responsible for handling the HTTP requests
	-> This annotation is used to the MVC architectural pattern for building web applications

=> Handler Methods :-
	-> These methods are also known as URL Handler Methods
	-> These methods are responsible for processing the incoming requests, performing business logic and preparing model data to be rendered by view page
	-> In order to map the incoming rendered or URL, handler methods can be annotated with HTTP methods related annotations i.e. @RequestMapping, @PostMapping, @GetMapping etc
	
	-> Case studies for handler methods :-
		1. We can provide any name for handler method
		2. We can have any return type for handler method such as String (representing a view name) or ModelAndView (a container for model data and view name) etc
		3. We can use non-primitive data type as a parameter for handler methods. However, primitive data types can be also used but they are typically used for simple cases like receiving query parameters
	-> NOTE : From above points it is clear that the handler method is very flexible and thus this approach is mostly used

=> HTTP Methods Related Annotations :-
	-> Some annotations related to HTTP Methods are :-
		1. @RequestMapping
			= This is a versatile annotation that can be used for handling various HTTP methods i.e. GET, POST etc
			= It can be applied at the method level or class level
			= Syntax :-
				>> @RequestMapping("/url")
				>> @RequestMapping(value = {"/url1", "/url2", "/url3"})
				>> @RequestMapping(value = "/url", method = RequestMethod.POST) <<==>> @PostMapping("/url")
				>> @RequestMapping(value = "/url", method = {RequestMethod.POST, RequestMethod.GET})
		2. @GetMapping
			= It is used for handling HTTP GET requests
			= It's a specialized form of @RequestMapping for GET method
		3. @PostMapping
			= It is used for handling HTTP POST requests
			= It's a specialized form of @RequestMapping for POST method
		etc
