=> HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) :-
	-> HTTP is a protocol (set of rules and regulation) that defines how data is transmitted and formatted and how web servers and web browser should respond to various commands and requests
	-> In simple terms, HTTP is a protocol that enables us to request and receive web pages, images, videos or any other resources when we browse the internet


=> HTTP Methods :-
	-> HTTP methods are the commands or actions that indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource identified by a URL. These methods define the operations we want to carry out on a server then making an HTTP request
	-> Some HTTP methods are :-
		1. GET
		2. POST
		3. PUT
		4. DELETE
		5. HEAD
		6. OPTIONS
		7. PATCH
		8. TRACE
		   etc

=> Difference between GET and POST :-
	1. Purpose :-
		= GET is used to retrieve the data from server. It does not perform any change at server side.
		= POST is used to send data to the server for processing. It performs some changes at server side.
		
	2. How data is transfered :-
		= In case of GET, data is transfered to the server through URL.
		= In case of POST, data is transfered to the server using request body.
		
	3. Security :-
		= GET is less secured because data is visible in the URL. Thus we should not use GET request in case of sensitive data like password
		= POST is more secured because data is transfered through request body which is not visible. Thus we can use POST request in case of sensitive data like password
		
	4. Amount of data :-
		= We cannot send large amount of data using GET because it transfers the data using URL.
		= We can send large amount of data (images, files, videos etc) using POST because it transfers the data using request body.
		
	5. Examples :-
		= GET :-
			- Fetching web pages
			- Performing the search query
			  etc
		= POST :-
			- Submitting the form
			- Uploading any file, images or videos
			- Making payment through website
			  etc
			  
	6. Bookmarked :-
		= GET request can be bookmarked
		= POST request cannot be bookmarked
		
	7. Caching :-
		= GET requests can be cached by browsers and intermediary systems. This can improvide the performace in some cases
		= POST requests cannot be cached
