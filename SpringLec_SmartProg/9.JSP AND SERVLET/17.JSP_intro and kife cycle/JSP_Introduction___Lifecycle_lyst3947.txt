=> JSP (Java Server Pages) :-
	-> JSP is server side technology which is used to create dynamic web pages
	-> Using JSP technology, we can embed Java code into HTML code
	
	-> JSP is an advanced version of servlet technology
		= In servlets we embed HTML code within Java code
		= In JSP we embed Java code within HTML code

	-> What is difference between Servlet & JSP :-
		1. Servlet is a java code
		   JSP is the HTML-based code
		   
		2. It is hard to write code in servlets
		   It's easier to write code in JSP
		   
		3. Servlets are fast as compared to JSP
		   JSP are slower as compared to servlets because it takes time to convert into servlet and compile the servlet

		4. In MVC architecture, servlets work as a controller
		   In MVC architecture, JSP works as a view to display the output
		   
		5. Modification in servlet file is time consuming due to reloading, recompilation and restarting the server
		   Modification in JSP is fast as just we need to click refresh button
		   
	-> Features of JSP :-
		1. Simplified Development
			= JSP simplifies web development by combining Java and HTML for dynamic web pages
		2. Built-in Tags :-
			= JSP includes built-in tags like scriptlet tag, action tags, custom tags to streamline coding
		3. Easy Maintenance :-
			= JSP promotes maintability, flexibility and portability
		4. No Recompilation :-
			= Changes to JSP page doesnt require recompilation and redeployment
		5. Extention to servlet :-
			= JSP is an extention of servlet technology for easier web app development
			
	-> How to create JSP pages :-
		1. Create a text file with .jsp extension
		2. Write HTML code for page structure
		3. Embed Java code to generate dynamic content by using tags i.e. <%----=%> or <jsp:----> etc
	-> NOTE :-
		1. JSP pages should be created in webapp folder.
		2. We can also create jsp pages in WEB-INF folder but when we want to access jsp page then we have to provide the mapping in web.xml file because WEB-INF folder is private

=> Static Web Pages :-
	-> Static web pages are pre-built and do not change the content unless manually editted by web developer
	-> Static web pages are created in HTML, CSS etc
	-> Static pages are fast to load because there is no server-side processing involved
	-> Examples :-
		- home pages
		- login and register pages
		- portfolio pages
		- website information pages
		  etc
		  
=> Dynamic Web Pages :-
	-> Dynamic web pages change their content based on the user-input or database updates or external factors
	-> Dynamic web pages are created in Servlets, JSP, Spring, PHP, Python etc
	-> Dynamic web pages are more versatile but may take longer time to load due to server-side processing
	-> Examples :-
		- Profile pages
		- Social networking websites home pages
		- Shopping web pages
		  etc

=> JSP Life Cycle :-
	1. JSP Loading:
		= The JSP page is loaded into the server
	2. JSP Parsing:
		= The JSP container parses the JSP page to identify Java code
	3. JSP Translation:
		= The JSP page is translated into servlet page
	4. Servlet Compilation:
		= The java servlet source code is compiled
	5. Servlet Loading:
		= The compiled servlet class is loaded
	6. Servlet Instantiation:
		= An instance of servlet is create
	7. Servlet Initialization:
		= The servlet object is initialized
	8. Servlet Processing:
		= The servlet handles the client requests
	9. Servlet Destruction:
		= The servlet is destroyed dusring undeployment or server shutdown
