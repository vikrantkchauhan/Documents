=> MVC (Model View Controller) :-
	-> MVC is a design pattern which is used to separate the different layers of an application i.e. we are able to separate the model layer, UI/presentation layer and controller layer
	
	-> Architecture of MVC (for simple applications) :-
	
	-> MVC have 3 components :-
		1. M (Model) :-
			= Model is used to manages the application's data (handles the data storage, retrival and manipulation) and business logic
			= "POJO (Plain Old Java Object) Classes" acts as model
		2. V (View) :-
			= View represent the UI/Presentation layer which is transfered to the client as a response
			= There are 2 types of views:-
				- static view (HTML, CSS etc)
				- dynamic view (JSP, JSTL etc)
		3. C (Controller) :-
			= Controller is used to handle the client requests and process user inputs and events
			= Controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view
			= "Servlets" acts as controller
