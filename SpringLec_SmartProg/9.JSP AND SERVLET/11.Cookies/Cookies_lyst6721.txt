=> Cookies :-
	-> Cookie is a small piece of data (object) that is stored on the client side i.e browser and sent back to the server with each subsequent request
	-> Cookie stores the data in "name-value" pair, for eg.
		= Expires : Sat, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 GMT
		= Secure : true
		= HttpOnly : true

			= These cookies are available for the duration of user's browser session. When the user closes their browser, temporary cookies gets deleted.
			= These cookies are stored in browser's memory (RAM)
		2. Permanent Cookie (Persistent Cookie)
			= These cookies are available till their expiration date even when the user closes the browser.
			= These cookies are stored in the file on user's computer i.e. hard disk
