=> URL-Rewritting :-
	-> URL-Rewritting is the technique which is used to modify or enhance the URL's by adding query parameters or any other information to them
	-> This technique allows web developers to pass the data between web pages and maintain state across multiple HTTP requests
	
	-> Uses of URL-Rewritting :-
		1. Session Tracking Mechanism
		2. Passing Query Parameters
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

=> Session Tracking Mechanism :-
	-> For session tracking mechanism web containers makes the use of cookies (JSESSIONID). If the client disables the cookies at browser then HttpSession and cookies will not work.
	-> In that case we have to use URL-Rewritting session tracking mechanism
	
	-> In URL-Rewritting we modify the provided URL by attaching JSESSIONID at the end of URL.
	-> For this HttpServletResponse interface has provided methods :-
		1. public String encodeURL(String url)
			= This method will attach JSESSIONID at the end of specified URL
			= If the cookies are enabled, then it will return the URL unchanged
		2. public String encodeRedirectURL(String url)
			= This method will work same as above method i.e. it will also attach the JSESSIONID at the end of provided URL.
			= This method works with sendRedirect() method.
			
	-> NOTE :-
		1. By default wen container will try to use cookie session tracking mechanism but if the cookies are disabled at the client side (browser) then automatically URL-Rewritting session tracking mechanism will come into work
		2. Mostly, we can use URL-Rewritting in case of dynamic web pages (servlets, JSP etc) and not for static web pages (html)
		3. URL-Rewritting is automatically handled by web-container, we only need to encode the URL
		4. JSESSIONID is automatically added in the URL but we can add the JSESSIONID manually by passing query parameters.
		
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

=> Passing Query Parameters :-
	-> URL-Rewritting is also used to pass query parameters and data within the URL's
	-> This is used to transfer the information or data from one page to another
	-> Syntax :-
		URL ? parameter1=value1 & parameter2=value2 & ____
		
	-> NOTE :
		= Do not send the sensitive data using query parameters
