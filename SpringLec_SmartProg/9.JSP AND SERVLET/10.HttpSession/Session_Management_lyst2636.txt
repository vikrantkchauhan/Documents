=> HTTP (Hypertext Trasfer Protocol) :-
	-> It is fundamental protocol for communication over the network. It enables data exchange between client and server
	-> NOTE :-
		= HTTP is text-based protocol and it operates over the TCP/IP network
		= HTTP is stateless protocol. It means that server is not able to judge whether the request is coming from single client or multiple client
		
		
=> Session :-
	-> It is a period during which a client interacts with the server
	-> It keeps the track of user's action, state and data during this time
	
	
=> What is "State" and "Data" :-
	-> State :-
		= State refers to the ability to maintain information about a client's interaction with the server ober multiple HTTP requests. It allows us to remember the client's identity and track their action across different pages or requests
		= For example :-
			1. User Authentication State :
				- Wheher the user is logged in or logged out
			2. Shopping Cart State :-
				- Wheher the user added some items to cart or not
			3. Form Progress State :-
				- When a user fills out a multip-step form, the step we are currently on, along with the data we have entered is the part of state. This allows us to resume where we left off
			4. Game Progress State :-
				- In online games, the level or stage a player has reached is the part of state
			5. Video Playback State :-
				- In video streaming services, the user's progress in a video (i.e. where we have stopped watching or any bookmarks we have added) represents the state
			etc
	-> Data :-
		= Data refers to the users information that has been tracked
		= For example :-
			1. User Profile Data :-
				- User specific details i.e. name, email, profile pic etc
			2. Shopping Cart Data :-
				- The details of items in shooping cart i.e. item name, item price, item quantity etc
			3. Session History Data :-
				- A record of users recent interactions i.e. browsing history, search queries, viewing products etc
			4. Form Input Data :-
				- Data entered by the user in web form during their session
			5. User Preferences Data :-
				- Specific settings and preferences choosed by the user i.e. saved address, saved payment modes etc
				
				
=> Session Management :-
	-> Session Management is the process of maintaining the state and data for individual users during their interaction with the server (web application)
	-> We can achieve session management by "HttpSession Objects" (In conjection with session tracking mechanisms like cookies, URL rewriting, hidden form fields etc)
	
	
=> Session Tracking Mechanism :-
	-> It is the technique by which server tracks whether the request is coming from one client or not
	-> We can achieve it by :-
		1. Cookies
		2. URL Rewriting
		3. Hidden Form Fields
		   etc

=> HttpSession :-
	-> HttpSession is an interface provided in Java Servlet API
	-> It's implementation is provided by the "web containers" for eg Apache Tomcat etc
	-> While it is referred as an interface, it is used to represent an object that provides the session management in servlet-based applications
	
	
=> HttpSession Object :-
	-> How to create/get HttpSession Object :-
		1. public HttpSession getSession()
		2. public HttpSession getSession(boolean b)
		   (Above methods are present in "HttpServletRequest" interface)
		
	-> How to handle the data in HttpSession Object :-
		1. public void setAttribute(String name, Object value)
		2. public Object getAttribute(String name)
		3. public Enumeration getAttributeNames()
		4. public void removeAttributes(String name)
		
	-> How to destroy the HttpSession Object :-
		1. public void invalidate()
		2. public void setMaxInactiveInterval(int time)
