=> "web.xml" File :-
	-> To access any servlet from browser, we have to tell the servlet container that which servlet it has to deploye and according to provided URL which servlet it has to invoke. For this purpose we use "web.xml" file
	-> "web.xml" file is also known as "deployment descriptor file"
	
	-> Responsibilities of web.xml file :-
		1. Servlet configurations
		2. JSP file configurations
		3. Filters configurations
		4. Listeners configurations
		5. Initialization parameters configurations
		6. Context parameters configurations
		7. Session timeout configurations
		8. Welcome file configurations
		9. Error page configurations
		10. Servlet load-on-startup configurations
		    etc
			
	-> Syntax :-
		<web-app>
			<servlet>
				<servlet-name> ms </servlet-name>
				<servlet-class> package_name.MyServlet </servlet-class>
			</servlet>
			<servlet-mapping>
				<servlet-name> ms </servlet-name>
				<url-pattern> /myser </url-pattern>
			</servlet-mapping>
		</web-app>
		
	-> NOTE :-
		= We create "web.xml" file in "WEB-INF" folder
		= In latest application, we normally use annotations. In legacy projects or in case of complex configurations we use "web.xml" file
