=> How to use JDBC in real world projects development :-
	= NOTE : JDBC is less used for enterprise applications because there are a lot of drawbacks of JDBC and to remove these drawbacks we use frameworks i.e. hibernate, JPA, Data JPA etc
	
	1. Use try-catch-finally block
	2. Use try-with-resources
	3. Use static method approach
	
	= NOTE : Above all approches are not efficient. For database connections we use "connection pooling" concept
