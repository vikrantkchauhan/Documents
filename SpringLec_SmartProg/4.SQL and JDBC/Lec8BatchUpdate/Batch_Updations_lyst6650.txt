=> Batch Updations :-
	-> It is a batch of updates grouped together and sent to the database in one batch rather then sending them one by one
	-> Advantages :-
		= Application performance will be improved
		= Network traffic will be reduced
	-> Disadvantages :-
		= It can only be used for "insert, update and delete" SQL query, not for select SQL query
		= If any single SQL query gets an error then it will disturb the flow of program
	
	-> How to achieve batch updations :-
		= For batch updations we have 3 methods :-
			1. addBatch(String query)
			2. executeBatch() -> int[]
			3. clearBatch()
		= NOTE : These methods are present in Statement and PreparedStatement interface
