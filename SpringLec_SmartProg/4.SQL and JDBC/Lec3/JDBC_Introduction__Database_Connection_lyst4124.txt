=> JDBC :-
	-> JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity
	-> JDBC is a technology which is used to interact the java application with database
	
	-> JDBC is also an API (pre-defined interfaces, classes and packages)
	-> NOTE : JDBC is an abstraction which is provided by Sun-Microsystems and implemented by database vendors (and provide them in the form of jar files)
	
	-> Working of JDBC :-
		= Diagram
		
	-> JDBC Components :-
		= Driver (Translator) :
			- It is used to convert the java calls to database specific calls and database specific calls to java calls
		= Connection (Road) :
			- It is used to create connection between java application and database
		= Statement / PreparedStatement / CallableStatement (Truck) :
			- It is used to send the SQL Queries (with data) from java application to database and get the result
		= ResultSet (Box) :
			- It is used to store the output from database
			
	-> Steps to create database connection :-
		1. Load and register driver
			= Class.forName("Driver ClassName");
			
		2. Establish the connection between java application and database
			= DriverManager.getConnection("url", "username", "password");
