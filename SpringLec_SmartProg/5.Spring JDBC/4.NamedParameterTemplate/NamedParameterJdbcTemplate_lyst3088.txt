=> NamedParameterJdbcTemplate :-
	-> It is the class which is provided by Spring framework as the part of Spring-JDBC module
	-> It provides "higher-level abstraction" and more convenient way to work with SQL queries
		= A "higher-level abstraction" means that it provides user-friendly way to interact with the system as compared to lower-level abstraction
	
	-> Why we need NamedParameterJdbcTemplate :-
		= In JdbcTemplate, we provide "Positional Parameters" which is not user-friendly because if there are a lot of positional parameters then it will create confusion. To remove this confusion we use NamedParameterJdbcTemplate in which we use "Named Parameters" 
		
	-> We can provide "Named Parameters" by 2 ways :-
		1. By using Map <interface>
			= We can use any implemented class of Map interface for eg. HashMap etc
		2. By using SqlParameterSource <interface>
			= We can use below implemented classes :-
				a. MapSqlParameterSource
				b. BeanPropertySqlParameterSource
